Java doesnot support multiple inheritance because of ambiguity.


Lets say there are 2 classes A and B, both have a method named Abhishek().

Also, B extends A.

Now, we made an object in a psvm consisting class and called Abhishek().

Since there are 2 methods with the same name in A and B, there will be ambiguity.

Hence, Java doesnot support multiple inheritance.
