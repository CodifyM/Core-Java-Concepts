# interface are similar to abstract classes, the only differene is all the methods within an 
interface will become abstract. 
And, as u know the abstract classes cannot be instantiated hence interface cannot be 
instantitated either.

# It is mandatory to have the defintion of interface's method which implements it. Eg below:

# To call function of interface do following:

package com.package1.project;


interface Lify{
	void methodify();
}

class Tify implements Lify{

	@Override
	public void methodify() {
		System.out.println("Odibaba!");
	}
	
}

public class InterfaceDemo {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Lify obj = new Tify(); // you cannot create an object of a Lify as Lify is declared as an interface, hence instead
                           // we'd given the reference of Lify and made an object of Tify and then called Tify by makeing 
                           // Tify's object.
		obj.methodify();
	}

}
