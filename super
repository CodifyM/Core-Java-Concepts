In Java, the "super" keyword is used to refer to the superclass of a class. The "super" keyword is typically used in two situations:

1. Accessing superclass methods or variables: When a subclass overrides a method or variable of its superclass, 
   it can use the "super" keyword to access the overridden method or variable of the superclass.
   
   class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public void eat() {
        super.eat(); // calls the eat() method of the superclass
        System.out.println("Cat is eating");
    }
}
