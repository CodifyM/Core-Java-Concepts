// Variables as name suggest are pron to change!
// Eg.


package com.package1.project;

public class FirstClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		//System.out.println("HelloWorld");
		//System.out.println(5);
		
		int a = 2;
		a = 3;
		System.out.println(a);
	}

Output:
3


Another Code for other concept:
package com.package1.project;

public class FirstClass {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		System.out.println("HelloWorld");
		System.out.println(5);
		
		int a = 2;
		a = 3;
		System.out.println(a);
		
		
		long x = 2000000000000l; //l at the last is required to let compiler understand that the variable x is having a huge (bigger value) then its capacity,
		                         // so when you use l at the last it(x) will store the value and will not throw the error
		
		
		
		float y = 332.3f; // f at the last is required to let compiler understand that the variable y is having a huge (bigger value) then its capacity,
		                  // so when you use f at the last it(y) will store the value and will not throw the error 
	}

}
