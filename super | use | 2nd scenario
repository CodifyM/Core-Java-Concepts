Invoking superclass constructors: When a subclass constructor is called,
it must call the constructor of its superclass before executing its own code. This is done using the "super" keyword.

class Animal {
    int age;
    
    public Animal(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    String name;
    
    public Cat(int age, String name) {
        super(age); // calls the Animal constructor
        this.name = name;
    }
}
